## 🎯 NEXT STEPS

### **Option 1: Manual Completion (Recommended for Quality)**
Continue manually updating each page type:
1. Complete remaining location hub pages (5 pages)
2. Update fleet pages (5 pages)
3. Update about pages (10 pages)
4. City-specific service pages can use templates

**Estimated Time:** 3-4 hours

### **Option 2: Template-Based Approach**
Create reusable components/templates for:
- City hub pages (common structure)
- City-specific service pages (very similar across cities)
- Fleet pages (similar structure)

**Estimated Time:** 1-2 hours setup + testing

### **Option 3: Automated Script**
Write a script to:
1. Scan all pages
2. Identify content sections
3. Auto-insert relevant internal links based on keywords
4. Add HTML comments

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours development + testing
**Risk:** May need manual review/fixes
