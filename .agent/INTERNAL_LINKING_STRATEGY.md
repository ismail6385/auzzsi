## Implementation Guidelines

### **Best Practices:**
1. **Natural Flow**: Links should feel organic, not forced
2. **Anchor Text Variety**: Don't repeat same anchor text multiple times
3. **Relevant Context**: Link only when it adds value to the reader
4. **Distribution**: Spread links throughout content, not clustered
5. **Deep Linking**: Link to specific pages, not just homepage
6. **User Intent**: Consider what user might want to explore next

### **Avoid:**
- ❌ Over-optimization (too many exact-match keywords)
- ❌ Irrelevant links (linking just for SEO)
- ❌ Broken link chains (linking to pages that don't exist)
- ❌ Same anchor text repetition
- ❌ Clustering all links in one paragraph

### **Link Styling:**
- Color: Navy blue (#1e3a8a or #1a2b4b)
- Decoration: Gold underline (#c5a467)
- Hover: Gold background with white text
- Font-weight: 600 (semi-bold)

---

## Tracking & Maintenance

### **Monthly Review:**
- Check for broken internal links
- Update anchor text if page titles change
- Add new service/location pages to linking strategy
- Monitor which internal links get most clicks (via analytics)

### **Priority Pages for Internal Linking:**
1. Homepage (highest authority)
2. Service pages (conversion-focused)
3. Location hubs (local SEO)
4. Fleet pages (product showcase)
5. About pages (trust-building)
